Welcome to my digital garden! Here you will find a collection of some notes that I have taken on various topics (mostly technical) that I found interesting. Making this public in the hopes that it might be somewhat interesting and/or helpful to you too!

Do note that this whole thing is very much a continous Work-in-Progress so if you find something wrong, either with the site itself or the contents, I implore you to make a comment in that page or file a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/bhodrolok/yadg/issues).

To know a bit more about me, check out my website [here](https://www.bhodrolok.xyz).
